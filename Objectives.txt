System: 
Generate a solar System with Settings available.
I want to be able to setup planets in moving orbits based on simulations, develop a tool to create them and visualize the orbits, and so on. 

Planets:
Each planet should have its own geography and atmosphere. 
The first would involve procedural generation methods, such as marching cubes, and others. The second cloud generation and light refraction.

Player: 
Make a character which can move through the space and interact with the planets

Animals: 
When approaching a planet, maybe even when approaching certain biome of a planet, certain animals should appear. 
For exemple: birds, fishes, and other creatures.

Boids:
Some of the previous animals should have boid-like behavior, simply relying on ray-based collision detection. Others i would like to be more advanced, to use neural networks and genes, and perhaps setup some kind of evolving environment with both predators and prey.
